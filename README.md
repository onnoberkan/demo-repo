woah man nice bod

what to do when you gotta make some changes:

1) make the goddamn changes
2) save them on vs code
3) "git add ."
4) "git commit -m ${message} -m ${message description}"
5) "git push origin master"
    5.5) if origin causes an error -> "git remote add origin ${git ssh url}"

# trials

how to merge: terminal -> git merge ${name of branch you want to merge with the branch you're on}
how to save to current branch: terminal -> git push --set-upstream origin ${the branch you're on}
